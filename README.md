# Jamie's Travel

With this app, we help Jamie to decide her next destination, either Amsterdam, Madrid or Budapest.
She would like to go somewhere with good weather or cheap flights(or both).

This app evaluates the different destinations by calculating the score based on the weather and ticket price.
